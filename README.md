## About
This is the first assignment of the Odin Project curriculum. I learned how to create a simple recipes webpage with HTML elements, and utilize the terminal with git commands to create directories and files. HTML elements include paragraphs, headers, links, images, and unordered and ordered lists.

Upon clicking the names of the recipes, you will be brought to a separate webpage detailing the ingredients and steps for that recipe.
